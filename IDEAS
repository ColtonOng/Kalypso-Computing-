IDEAS:
 1. A audio recorder like audacity but is specifically used for recording raps or songs quick and easy 
    If you like a instrumental on youtube you can automatically paste the link into the application and it will convert it into a mp3
    and make the file small and compressed so you can start rapping over it in seconds. This takes out the annoyance of having to go to 
    another website to enter in your youtube link and then having to download the mp3 file then openening it in audacity
